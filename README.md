# PhotoShare-A-Photo-Social-Network-System
This project implements a database system for a web based photo social sharing application. I designed both the database and the web-base interface to interact with the database. This system is similar to other photo sharing websites like Flickr. The system is somewhat bare-bones and needs quality of life changes but it is fully functional.
